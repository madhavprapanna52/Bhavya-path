# Suraksha Path 
Making an secure, trust worth sustainable and environment friendly sollution for public transportation and mobility using mordern tools and techniques

AIM : Provide travelers an sequre and good alternative for traveling which includes an step towards less carbon emmision, less trafic congession with secure way for travel

Features to target
    > Computing least costing routes to the destination with sharing centric planning system results
        - Graphical nodes with weights and using algorithm to find optimal sollution
    > Planning trips with all possible modes of traveling
        - Planning full trip for destination via different means to reduce cost and promote sharing and least emmision
    > Alert system
        - System that centers to provide information about effects of natural outcomes to travel plan
            -> water log tracing system } Authenticating water log with weather api + local ensurred response
    > Safety measures
        - Camera based monitoring of ride for pasenger safety
        - Emergency services mechanism trigerring alerts and emergency situation to ensure pessanger safety
